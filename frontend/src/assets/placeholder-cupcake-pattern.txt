This file serves as a placeholder for the cupcake-pattern.png image.

For a complete implementation, you would need to add a cupcake pattern image here.
The recommended image should be:
- Size: 400x400 pixels (will be tiled)
- Content: A repeating pattern of bakery items (cupcakes, pastries, etc.)
- Style: Light, subtle design to use as a background
- Format: PNG with transparency

Recommended placement: frontend/src/assets/cupcake-pattern.png
